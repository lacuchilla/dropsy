Dropsy is a C# version of the game
[Drop7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop7 "Google's Homepage"). This was a C# practice exercise that I collaborated on with other engineers during my internship at Enlearn. We were given a series of "stories" that increased in complexity. We only knew one story at a time, and we often had to rethink our strategies and refactor code to complete each subsequent story.

Completed Stories:
 1. Build and display an empty 1x1 to 9x9 box
 2. Add Column Labels
 3. Create a chip with a random value less than or equal to 9 and draw the chip at top center of the board
 4. Allow the user to pick which column the chip drops into using a keypress
 5. Allow the user to drop multiple chips, the dropped chips stack on top of each other, attempting to drop a chip into a full column does nothing, and the game ends when all columns are full
 6. Every fifth turn, add a row of blocks to the screen (character 219 â–ˆ ), and push the current chips on the screen up one level
 7. If adding blocks to a column causes it to overflow, the game is over.

Current Story:
 8. Add popping feature. A chip pops if it is in a column with the same number of chips as its value or if it is in a row with the same number of chips touching it contiguously. The animation sequence is to draw the chip on the board, draw an asterisk in the same place as the chip, then make the asterisk disappear.
